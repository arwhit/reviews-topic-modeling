Unfortuantly, one major frustration with this watch comes from the reseting of the chronograph.  While most analog choronographs I have seen have the minute and second hand snap to zero in under 2 seconds (some completing a rotation), this watch takes nearly 2 minute to reset!  I'm not sure why, but the second hand literally unwinds once for each minute you have timed.  In other words, if you clock 30 minutes, it needs to unwind 30 times.  This is very frustrating if you need to stop and reset instantly (as you need to between the successive 35 minute sections of the LSAT). The good news is that past 30 minutes, the second hand unwinds forward (so at 45 minutes, the second hand unwinds 15 times, not 45 times.Other than that, the only criticism I would have is the physical size of case.  It is nearly 1/2 an inch thick! This makes it easy to catch on things, and hard to slip under a shirt sleeve.Other things to keep in mind: Some descriptions say the chronograph has hr, min, sec, and 10th seconds... this is incorrect.  The chronograph is only min, sec, and 10th seconds--the hr display subdial is a 24 hr clock.All-in-all, if you don't mind a large case, this watch seems like it would be great for timing sport events and is a sort of funky-looking watch.

The rubber tore where it attached to the case---and that was simply from taking the watch off. No bike crashes, no playing sports. Just removing it. At that time, the yellow in the engraved Lance Armstrong signature on the case back had also come off. As a matter of fact, it actually stuck to my wrist.

And I have to say, my disappointment began within 2 minutes of opening the shipping box.  Here are the three major ways this watch (and Nike itself) have failed me:1) This is a complicated, multi-function instrument.  But if you're expecting a detailed instruction manual, forget it.  What you get is an elaborate pictograph that illustrates which buttons to push.  It skims over the setup procedure and many of the most important functions, and omits many features entirely.2) Relative to the above complaint, I contacted Nike customer service about the setup.  Since I'm a cyclist, I was particularly interested in the altimeter function, and dismayed by how thin the \"manual\" is.  The instructions say you can select a 60-, 10- or 2-second sampling rate of the barometric pressure in order to determine altitude.  What it fails to mention is what the ramifications are for choosing one over the other?  Is one more accurate?  Does one use more battery power?  We'll apparently never know, because Nike's customer service failed to answer the question.  While they admitted that they had received several complaints about the manual -- and were considering writing a new one -- they simply sidestepped my question about the altimeter function in their email reply.3)  And then there's the performance of the watch itself.  In most cases it's impressive -- that is, in every case except the one for which I purchased it:  the altimeter.  On my group rides, there are always at least three other people with altimeters.  A post-ride comparison of altimeter results always puts their readings within 3 percent of each other.  The results from the Nike are at least 20 percent off.  That means the altimeter results are not to be trusted.While the watch is attractive (that's why it earned 2 stars instead of just one) and has an excellent band, it simply doesn't give me the accurate altimeter results I need.  And since the altimeter results are so far off, I can only assume that its built-in weather sensor (also based on barometric pressure) is hugely flawed, too.With the manual being as light on information as it is, with Nike's customer service either unwilling or unable to shed any light on the watch's usage and with the flawed performance of the altimeter function, I can only say that this watch represents a major disappointment.  It may meet Nike's standards for fashion, but it fails my standards for performance.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A major disappointment from Nike", "unixReviewTime": 1158105600, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2006"}

Overall I found the product let down by quality control issues.  The first watch I got had to be returned due to the USB pod simply not working at all.  Kudos to Amazon for replacing it promtly. The second watch worked for a while - about 200km - then started to give intermittant HRM readings.  Overall I found the HRM strap needed to be tighter than my Polar and that the reading did require that I wet the pads everytime before starting my run.The other thing that the Polar range has over Nike is that when you run at night it's easy to just bring the Polar up to your chest and the light comes on - not with Nikes best - It requires you know which of the 5 buttons to press, to get the light on - easy if you do it right, but you can accidently stop the run recording if you press the wrong button in the dark while running.Buy lots of CR2032 batteries because you need to change them often.  I have already changed the watch and the HRM battery in the first 175km, and the watch was set to power saving mode.Although it works OK with OSX 10.4.9 the Nike software has not been updated since 2004 - that's 3 years - of no new driver or feature support - pretty good indication that Nike has moved it's attention elsewhere.  The monitor area is poorly used with a small 9\" window opens up on your 20\" Mac which cannot be enlarged - then you get small little graphs you can hardly see.  My advise is, if you buy a few spare parts like a HRM, footpod and USB unit then it should give you good data - otherwise expect to take it back under warranty - while you can.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Nike Elite is feature Rich, runs on Mac OSX, but Quality control is poor", "unixReviewTime": 1180310400, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2007"}

I expect the Nike First-String Slides to arrive in a few days and will follow-up with some hands-on, foots-on results in a few weeks. Spent three hours scouring the thousands of listings here and elsewhere for my $25 or under sandals...time not wasted since I now have a list of preferred products to try. Previously, have used the $19 Okabashi Euro with mixed results. First thing to note is their sizing recomendations, at least for that model, run a little large. Have posted a sep.review on that page.Most of the slip-on sandals in the $15-$30 price range, the enclosed-top type, are not that well made. The Okabashis mentioned, for example, were great four years ago. Since then, they have used a cheaper plastic compound, the things lasting half as long as prev before straps crack/break. I picked the Nike this time because it appears to cup the foot snugly (bad ankle), has what appears to be a decent non-slip sole and looks to be somewhat durable. A previous reviewer found these sandals to be uncomfortable but, by appearance, they will be what I need at a good price. If these don't work out, will spend $30 for an adjustable top-strap type, probably from Adidas or New Balance, IF I can find a model dark enough to obscure those moronic color blazes and checkmarks. I had to assign a rating for this, so starting with a four-star pending a proper review (below).Feb10 follow-up:  Received the sandals as ordered, correct color, size. The seller, ASBY SPORTS/PENTAKIC was fine. The sandal design/matl's were not. Though they look nice, fit well and were comfortable for my one-time carpet-walk, they have one fatal flaw, described below. As for size, the size 10 was good for me. I have close to a size 11 foot. For a guy with size-10 feet, these size 10's would be a little loose. The problem I found, obvious on opening the box, was that the sandal is molded from one piece of extremely lightweight plastic with a shiny, slippery-smooth sole. One reason I ordered these sandals was the claim on the JC Penney website, \"injection molded Phylon sole for great durability and traction.\" Traction? All I can say about this is that anyone wearing these things on damp kitchen or bathroom tiles, or around a swimming pool, will slip and fall within ten microseconds of stepping on the wet surface. The only reason I'm rating these suicide-slides two-stars rather than one is that they would be okay in Arizona or any other bone-dry climate and they are nicely designed aside from the slippery soles.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "pre-review", "unixReviewTime": 1328313600, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2012"}

My older sandal had a much thicker sole with a thick tread pattern for non-slip walking, and had a form fitted arch so that my foot neatly fitted into it without slipping when walking, etc. This sandal has none of those good design properties: its sole is much thinner in comparison with minimal arch support; and the tread pattern is comprised of relatively small ridges that do not appear to be thick enough to prevent slipping on wet hard surfaces.Also as another reviewer mentioned the underside of the front support is a fabric-like material that absorbs moisture like crazy so no wonder he said they smelled \"funky\" after a short time..this material if it stays wet is expected to be subject to mold growth.Btm line: save your $ and don't buy this sandal, especially if you've owned similar older Nike sandals. I'm keeping these but will only use them at the gym in the locker shower room which is the intended purpose, but what a disappointment! I'm keeping my older Nike sandals which although they are worn, they are vastly superior design and quality-wise.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Very Disappointing Sandals Compared to Previous Model", "unixReviewTime": 1385510400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2013"}

Or at least the pair i received was. if you dont know what a B grade is it is a shoe that was made by nike but in the factory when they made it it was not perfect. There was one little flaw. instead of tossing the pair nike finds somewhere to sell it besides one of there stores such as this amazon seller. The shoes fit fine there are no flaws to prove that they are replicas (fakes) but there is a clear flaw that is just a factory mistake by nike. I would post a picture if i could and you would see what i mean. When the shoes are on your feet and you look down at them right where the tip of the nike swoosh is (side closest to the toe of the shoe) there is a kind of curve in the charcol part that follows the curv. on one shoe the curv is perfect and pointed at the end like the nike swoosh but on the other shoe it is rounded and dosent have that same point. it is just a clear poor mistake by nike because if they were replicas these would be the best replicas ever made. Besides that they are some cool kicks but i wouldnt pay the full price for them if they are B grades. I would suggest buying them elsewhere. I am the only one who notices it but i feel like i was cheated of some of the money i spent on them. there very comfortable and i will still wear them till they wear out. you could still buy them but fully inspect the shoe before wearing them because once u wear them u are stuck with them they can not be refunded.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fine but one flaw!! read this before purchase IMPORTANT!", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2013"}

Stinnett", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "The first week with this shoe was OK as it was pretty comfortable, lightweight and seemed to handle well for my daily 5-6 mile runs.  However, after about 5 days the problems started to surface.  The biggest problem is that the soles of the shoes wear very quickly -- and it's not just this shoe, but it seems all new Nike shoes are made with material that wears quickly.  No doubt this is done because it means you can no longer get the 300-400 miles out of a running shoe you used to be able to, but now you are lucky if you get 200 miles.  Less miles means more sales for Nike.The flywire concept while \"neat\" at first really turned into a nightmare.  I soon discovered that this shoe had no support whatsoever.  On two occassions I almost twisted my ankle when going from road to grassy surface because this shoe has zero support and almost no stability.

Nylon is just a cheap material so I avoid it as much as possible as a rule.  Nike made these Cortez cheaper than their other Cortez.  Cortez is like a tough shoe like Lugz.  Now Nike makes weird shoes with silly colors so harder to get a decent shoe out of them.  I have been looking for the Cortez blue suedes for a long time like four years and have not been able to find them, only the leathers and nylons and this one is a cross of both so that is disappointing.

I probably will but leather tongue is more comfortable plus I plan on running a lot on these and leather is not as absorbent as nylon.  The nylon is going to get funky quick with my demanding workouts.  I guess I'm better off with track Asics and Adidas as it seems Nike is lowering their quality putting brand recognition over quality materials and construction.  Nike leather is cheap and thin and then they try to piece pleather of fabric in places to be even cheaper.  They are too greedy and as a result they are hurting their brand.

The Nike air max 2013, these shoes are the running shoes you see everybody wearing. Ads call them the new hot swagger if super stars got them why don't you. So many people fall for these Ads, but me ii think this product has a problem with it time span, all the different color, there's so many more problem with the shoe. The product has some good qualities but the shoe its self is just ugly for the price there sold for in all stores. These shoes are over priced at $200 a pair. This is my negative review about this product \"THE PRICE\".The prices for the Nike air max 2013 I think are overpriced. Why they cost so much is because of the product description, the Nike air max 2013 running shoes are the most flexible of its kind. People say when they go running the shoe is so flexible it fills as if there were no shoes on their feet. The shoe is so lightweight its 1.5 weight makes it fill as if you could run forever. I also think the prices for the Nike air max cost so much money is because of how comfortable the shoe is to the users.The shoe immediately out of the box looked cheap and seemed poorly made. The style of the shoe looks like it's not made to least still it's one of the best of its kind. People all over the world buys the Nike air max 2013 for running and running only it's understandable why, the shoe is great for running but the shoe is way too ugly to cost over $200.

When it was time to get some new shoes (i think they now design the soles to come off prematurely so that you have to buy new shoes) i checked a couple of nike outlet stores and could only find super flash basketball shoes.  After giving up i decided to try google and found that they do in fact still make basic looking high tops. i found a particular style and located it here and couldnt be happier with the cosmetics.  Of course i knew it was a gamble buying shoes online without trying them, but ive never been dissatisfied with my nikes before, even the pair i bought on amazon a number of years ago.when the shoes finally came in i was not let down cosmetically but when i went to put them on i couldnt get my foot in comfortably without loosening the laces on the top 3 or 4 lace holes. otherwise i have to stomp my foot into them.  Once my foot was in they were comfortable. its just getting it through the tops of the shoe. there is a loop on the back to hold the shoe back up to slide your foot in easier, but its so stubby that i cannot grip it properly when putting my foot into the shoe. i figured this would get easier as they broke in but that did not happen.thats all find and dandy, but my main reason for writing the review is to let it be known that these shoes could cause an injury.  From day one, i have not been happy with absorption of shock under my foot. come to think of it i dont think there is any arch support at all in these - its barely a step up from walking without any shoes. its not comfortable, but it doesnt hurt so i figured \"oh well\". well a couple of months later, i start noticing this pain in my left foot arch. I do a lot of walking for my job (work in a hospital) so i figured maybe it was that, but i've been doing it for over 2 years and have not had a problem yet.  I also havent changed any other walking patterns or habits. I assume the pain will pass but after 2 weeks it has only gotten worse. I do some research and find that my symptoms fit textbook Plantar Fasciitis, which one of the causes is bad shoes.so i found some gel insoles and have put them in these things, to try and salvage them.  Hopefully this, along with the recommended stretching and excercises, makes my Plantar Faciitis subsideI will never order shoes online again and, if i cant find anything cosmetically appealing in a store, will not order nike's again.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Worst Nike Shoe i've ever owned. developed a foot injury", "unixReviewTime": 1284854400, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2010"}

The polarized version is very dark (too dark to use on a bright but overcast day- the polarized lenses I got are really only suited for a bright sunny day). I've had other oakleys, natives, and ray-bans that provide the protection you need on a bright day without making things look \"muddy\", like these sunglasses do. I often find that I have to remove these sunglasses when I'm driving to read street signs, etc. Maybe a different lens would have performed better, and the tint/color is really a matter of personal preference, but that's just my opinion.The REAL issue is that after about a year of use, the lens coating started to just flake off from the inside, making the sunglasses useless for almost everything. The strange thing is that the coating on the outside is fine, it was just on the inside that they started developing spots where some sort of material just flaked off. Since the Nike warranty was only for 1 year, I was pretty much screwed as far as replacing them. I continued to use these for biking since they were SO expensive, and the problem has gotten much worse, to the point where I'm now going to have to throw these crappy plastic sunglasses away.If you are in the market for a pair like this, I'd suggest going with another brand that invests more in producing quality lenses. I've had oakleys that have lasted 6+ years without problems, and I know people with ray-bans that have even been passed down from their parents.

Normally, skaters go through shoes pretty consistently, if they're good enough to at least ollie. I was not. Over the course of a month, the sole of my shoe wore down until there was huge gaping hole in the bottom. Now, bare in mind, I did nothing technical. No jumps, tricks, or any of that. I was just learning the basics... like rolling and stopping. However, the sole wore down until it was a smooth surface which could grip nothing. The same would have happened if I didn't skate, it just would have taken about three months longer. I do not recommend these shoes, especially for the 60$ price tag.

So I contacted Nike customer service. Now, most companies will simply replace defective product.  Not Nike. You get to send them back at your own expense and they will \"determine whether they replaceable or not.\"A visit to the Nike website was really eye-opening.  Review after review complained about the squeak in these shoes. It's pretty obvious to me that Nike couldn't care less about this negative feedback or they would have addressed the issue long ago.Needless to say, I've given up on the Nike brand entirely, and the only consolation for all my wasted time and money is to be able to tell everyone my Nike squeak story and to tell them that IMO, Nike has become a third rate company.  I would strongly recommend you avoid Nike, until they stop selling products they (should) know are defective, and stop ignoring customer complaints.BTW, I finally went back to the out-of-town retailer where I purchased them and they replaced them - with another pair that squeaks even worse.

The shoes are comfortable, but I have serious doubts about the \"blown rubber\" used in the sole and the stated design for neutral runners. On the right side I had excessive wearing of the midfoot to heel region, to the extent that the inner of the shoe poked through. This was repeated, but to a lesser extent on the left side. I run exclusively on roads and rough surfaces and found this type of rubber not sufficiently durable for those of us that cover a 80km+ a month.I sent these back to Nike, and after two \"assessments\" I was told that this pattern of wear was due to an \"external force\" being applied - which is amusing if not insulting, considering I have Nike's own sensor data to prove how much I ran in these shoes.In addition, the sensor socket seemed to repeatedly under value the actual distance I ran. I only found this out by using the same sensor in another pair of shoes without sensor socket and by measuring out my running distance with gps. In the Vomero 6 at least I would sometimes get a discrepancy of 2km per run - which I suspect is due to its thick sole.I have since moved on to a pair of New Balance minimus, which are much more suited to my running style, and show markedly less wear on the heels, despite my covering the same distances as with the Vomero 6.I'm still trying top get an answer from Nike on what \"external force\" means.I'm giving this product 2 stars instead of one - because they were comfortable to run in while they lasted, and the construction of the upper was satisfactory. Otherwise its a very high price to pay for something that isn't as durable as it looks - at least in the sole department.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not for serious runners", "unixReviewTime": 1339200000, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2012"}

In particular I am referring to the atrocious \"barefoot technology\" touted by the Nike Frees. I can attest to the fact that those shoes are nothing like running or walking barefoot, and do you know why? It's because I just walked two miles up past the Mission in those shoes, and the two miles back barefoot. Now, this is probably why my brother thinks I should be made a ward of the state, a grown-ass woman walking around in the streets in bare feet in the summertime. Nevertheless, on the way up (shoes on) I was having pain in my right hamstring, stiffness in my ankles and could barely feel my feet. I felt like a Frankenstein. On the way back, everything harmonized and was made complete in my body, mind, and spirit. When I got back to the house, I threw those shoes right in the garbage can, then spent an indeterminate amount of time ecstatically watching a spider weave its web while eating salad. (My brother may have a point.)The feet are the hands that touch the earth--you want them to be free? Whenever possible, free them of shoes! I find it is more relaxing and safter to walk on grass, or sand, which made me think of the Buddhist teacher Pema Chodron who asks: does it make more sense to cover the whole world in leather, or make shoes for your feet? Buddhists say: Cold world no blanket. I say: We can work towards making the world a softer place, where it is safe to walk around bare-footed and truly free.

The mesh makes for quick drying after a good sweat.So why did I only give them three stars?Well, if I would have written the review right away it would have been five stars but I have noticed over time (a short period of time at that) that there's a weak spot on these socks.  When you pull them on you grip right below the upper border and maneuver them over your feet.  When pulling them snug to your lower ankle the material sort of gives a bit and your fingers go through the mesh.  Not all the way through but you hear a bit of ripping so it's just a matter of time before they do, I suppose.  I haven't poked through, yet, but that area looks distorted so I'm betting I'll poke through soon.This has happened on every pair even though I try to be careful.

The quality is gone.  I am sure that the material they are made of is by some definition \"leather\".  It feels and looks much more like plastic.  I doubt they would have held up through one winter and in terms of comfort and warmth they inspired very little confidence.  I returned them.  Why the 3 star review?  Honestly, my opinion is 1 star.  I have too much respect for my feet to ever put crap like these boots on them... but I do feel that part of that feeling stems from my own disappointment in the comparison to the boots I have.  That is not the fault of the boots I returned, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  I also can't verify the comfort or warmth factors... I never wore them.  If you do buy them, I hope that they meet your needs and thanks for taking the time to read my review.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Inadequate.", "unixReviewTime": 1359936000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2013"}

The shoes still take advantage of their lightweight and flexible design which is a signature to the Nike Free line. The low toe-to-heel rise is still present, and the new version has smaller gaps in the sole which means less issues with pebbles getting caught while running. Nevertheless the new version 4 has some major downfalls. The previous version 3 had an improved heel cup which fit close like a glove without being tight, the version 4 slide all over the place and have caused some blistering. Additionally, they have changed the material so it is no longer a breathable nylon, but a more plastic feel which sweats like a greenhouse. The new material is also very low quality. I only have 25 miles on these and the mid-foot fabric is already breaking through. The last 4 pair I had finally broke through in the front toe box between 700-800 miles.Overall I would either look for a different style shoe or a earlier version of the Nike Free shoes.

Let me tell you I was the first buyer of this shoe in the whole of India - bought it on the day of launch in Bangalore. But i must say that this shoe did not last as long as a shoe this expensive should. The sole wore out very quickly - within just 3 months. As a result, the air bubble popped and now the shoe is totally useless for me. I paid more than $200 for this shoe. And it lasted me only 200 kms. I won't recommend this shoe to anyone.

My purchase ended a minor romance with Brooks shoes that lasted for a little over 5 years. Nothing wrong with Brooks's products, I guess this is a \"me not you\" thing. I find that ordering shoes online is an ordeal and prefer a brick and mortar shop for this type of purchase.My first impression of the Nike Free was how light they feel in the hand and on the foot. Wearing them feels more like having a sock on your feet as opposed to a shoe. The appearance of the product is well-executed and I find that the shoe looks slick and sophisticated in black.The salesperson described this shoe as a step forward on the spectrum toward a minimalist running shoe. While not much a runner, and certainly not of the barefoot variety, I believe that this product provides greater road feel than traditional shoes. The sole is heavily siped and grooved allowing greater flexibility across lateral and longitudinal axes. While moving around you can feel the bed of the shoe conforming to the ground.The interior of the shoe is comfortable and despite its low weight provides adequate support. The upper is a synthetic mesh-like material that wraps the foot closely. For some reason it reminds me of the stretchy book-covers my kids buy at Staples before school starts.I took a half size larger remembering that Nike runs small. This shoe was no exception and the salesperson informed me that this particular model was designed to fit snugly. The shoe apparently runs really short and even after wearing these for a while I still feel uncomfortable. I tried a full size up in the store, but the back of the shoe felt quite loose at that point.While I think that these shoes deliver on many of the intended features that Nike's engineers packed in to this product, I am still left with some disgruntled toes. Are these shoes supposed to feel \"snug\" or are they simply \"too small\"? For someone looking at a change of pace, serious running, or a light comfortable wearer the Nike Free will fit your needs. I would just suggest being aware of sizing issues.Update 8/22/12:Correction made above. I reviewed my receipt which indicated a purchase price of $99 and not $89. Sorry for the error.Finish Line allowed me to exchange my size 9 to a 9.5 which is a full size up from my foot measurement. The shoe feels much better and is marginally loose at the heel. The enhanced comfort makes this a more satisfying experience although I could have foregone the agita of sizing the shoe.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Comfort with a caveat", "unixReviewTime": 1345507200, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2012"}

You feel as though you have light cushy pads attached to your feet, but with no upper support, it takes focus to land and stay neutral.  It snugs your foot alright, but the upper just seems to stretch with the force of each foot strike, letting your foot travel on top of the last.

I have a pair of the previous iteration (Nike Free Run+ 2), and I didn't think they could make anything more comfortable. I was wrong.Unfortunately, that's where the love affair ends. This was a sleek, beautiful black pair of shoes when first purchased. Unfortunately, after only two months of normal wear (not even everyday), the shoe looks a year or two old.1) The black outer material quickly broke down into showing white and gray creases and threads. This is most obvious in the star patterned \"slits\" around the sides. This makes the show now appear to have gray or \"graying\". (see user photo)2) Most disappointing is that the toe cap appears to be \"painted\" black rather than molded black. The slightest scuff will show through to the actual white material. And after a month or two of normal wear, it just looks awful. (see user photos)3) I keep finding tiny bits of black plastic under my sock when I take off the shoes. I can't find exactly where it's coming from, but it keeps appearing.Overall, one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. And yet, after only a few months of use, it looks too rough to wear in casual situations. At $100 a pair, I expect more.Comfort: 5 starsQuality: 2 starsOverall value: 2 stars---UPDATE Mar-2013:Based on the comments to my review, it sounds like I might have gotten a bad issue or they've since made changes/improvements since the first run, which I purchased.

My Free Run 2's were consistent in size with other models of Nike shoes, the Nike Free Run 3 is a narrower and shorter sized shoe. If you are coming off the FR2, you'll have to go to your local shoe store for a proper FR3 fitting.The FR2 construction was a single piece booty-type of construction, while the FR3 has a separate tongue design. For me I preferred the single piece booty design of the FR2 as I could lace the shoe looser.What I'm finding with the FR3 is that although I now have the length correct, the shoe is so narrow that you can feel it pinch the sides of my feet, no matter how loose I lace the shoe.Returning to the single piece versus the tongue design of the FR3, I find that the tongue will migrate to the outside of my foot, and bunch-up. The bunching-up along with the already narrow cut of the shoe makes my feet uncomfortable or tingly like they are falling asleep. For a shoe that is supposed to feel minimal, after a few miles of running that nuisance feeling wears on my psyche.As for the break-in period, for me it's been a grind. I keep four different models of shoes in my running rotation, and feel like I should be able to grab a pair of shoes and go, but not with the FR3. It took over a month of short walks (adding up to about 70 kilometers) before my feet built up enough callous specific to these shoes, for me to run in them.Had I never owned Free Run 2's, I probably wouldn't know to complain about the Free Run 3.

Comfort:  These tennis shoes doesn't need a break in period. Just from the first time them feel SUPERB. Great out of the box!. Padding at the toes and cushioning in the heel is absolutely great. Rating: 5/5.2. Weight: Feel really light.  Rating: 4,7/5.3. Stability: Very good, outstanding. Rating: 4,6/5.4. Traction: Uhmmm, I have been using them mostly on clay surface and I am very disappointed. These sneakers are slippery in humid clay. Rating: 3,0/5.  But I think them are good on hard surface (4,0/5).For spectacular traction on clay I still prefer Yonex Power Cushion SHT 307 Mens Tennis Shoes. Also I thinkadidas Men's Barricade 6.0 Tennis Shoehave better traction on clay.5. Durability: No doubt, long lasting tennis shoes. They come with a 6 month outsole limited warranty. Rating: 5/5.  When playing on red clay these get that color really easy and them are a little bit difficult to clean again.6. Ventilation: Very good. You won't feel your feet hot. Rating: 4,5/57. Price: Above other similar options and of course you pay for the brand, Rating: 3,8/5.8. Appearance: Awesome. Rating 4,5/5.BIG Con:-Laces loops break with time and there is no way to fix them. The only solution is to drill a hole above the place where the loop was (see pic.). This has happen with two (2) pairs of shoes I have bought.Sizes: I use 9,5 and these fit me ok, BUT beware with width because there are some complains and width foot players must test courtballistec carefully.I think these are amazing tennis shoes for the amateur, advanced, semipro or pro tennis player. Tennis instructors will love them because besides comfort, durability makes them attractive.P.S: I am an intermediate-advanced tennis player (NTRP: 4,5 level*); I like technical aspects about racquets, strings, tennis shoes and tennis accessories. Nowadays I am playing 80% of my time on clay surface and 20% on hard courts. I play 10-12 hours per week.I have other tennis items reviews, maybe can be useful 4 u.Votes are welcome ....

Well, this fits the bill (pun intended- note singular use of the noun) but they've taken the minimalist design a tad too far. Cards do not fit in the slots and once you have forced them in you need pliers to get them out. There are only 6 card slots but oddly when they are all filled the wallet is reluctant to close flat, and that's before you try to put anything in the hidden sections. And as far as folding money is concerned, my advice is to travel light; perhaps a couple of hundreds because much more than that and wallet is not going to fold flat. This is basically a step up from a money clip so unless you travel with maybe 4 credit (ATM, library, Moose Lodge Club, etc) cards, a couple of biz cards and a few bills you can drop the &#34;fold&#34; from &#34;billfold&#34;. Overall a nice looking wallet with just average construction. Oddly, the long section of leather is split into 2 pieces.

I was well on my way. Two convenience stores, a dollar store, and a bank robbery later and I had all but the $12 to ship. Unfortunately I took a $20 payday loan which i failed to pay back on time. In turn a bench warrant was placed on my for writing false checks and I was thrown in jail for a month. When I got out my incredible reasonably priced shoes were waiting. The only thing was this rat living near my cardboard box ate the laces while I was away. The reason I only gave this product three stars is because when I ordered an extra set of laces they wanted to charge my 50 cents. Unbelievable! Do they think I am made of money? At least the shipping was free. I am still trying to figure out where the power unit is that makes me fly may be but I am sure I will figure it out through Google.

When I opened the box and got my first glance, I truly could feel how John Travolta must have felt in Pulp Fiction when he opened the mysterious briefcase and saw what I can only assume was the glowing light of the soul of Jesus Christ, himself. This created a minor inconvenience in that I immediately lost control of my bowels and had to make a mad dash to my ivory-adorned master bathroom to tidy myself up a bit. After showering in my 20'X20', granite-inlaid shower stall and rinsing away the feces with the Fiji water that I have pumped directly into my home from a pipeline in the Fijian Islands, my staff of former Victoria's Secret models dressed me in my most luxurious Italian silk garments and I made a second attempt at simply gazing at these glorious shoes. Relieved that I did not lose control of my bodily functions this go-around, I was able to slip comfortably into the amazing feat of footwear which Nike had provided me. I instantly felt as though my feet were wrapped in the clouds of the heavens. I then decided it was time to go show off my newest addition to my collection of literally thousands of shoes. Making my way down my marble staircase it seemed as though I was floating, rather than taking steps. Each stair felt alive beneath me, as though some benevolent spirit recognized the footsteps of a god. Upon entering my 5-car garage, I decided upon the Lamborghini as opposed to the Maybach, as the Lambo gave me an opportunity to utilize 3 pedals, rather than 2, thus giving me more of a chance to utilize these shoes that at some point Jesus would have worn in his day. This is when the problems began. To my dismay, the size and flexibility of the shoes impeded my capacity to effectively operate the clutch and brake pedals of the least-affordable of the vehicles in my arsenal. Bah! If I can't operate the pedals in this clunker of an automobile with these shoes, they must be worthless. I managed to drive home successfully, park, walk the 190 yards to my California-king-sized bed, undress and -although furious at the fact that what I presumed to be the end-all, be-all of footwear were worthless to me- managed to sleep. When I awoke, I realized that the experience was little more than an elaborate dream, pushed my obese wife off of me, dressed myself in my cut-off jean shorts, fixed myself a bowl of Ramen noodles, put on my Converse Chuck Taylor's, got in my 87 Honda Civic and drove (without problems) to my job as an assistant manager at Carl's Jr. I hate my life.

The red/green checker and Kente cloth patterns to commemorate Black History Month are beautiful accents to a very well designed shoe. The use of blacks and grays combined with the aircraft styling of the Huarache line make this a stealthy shoe with a sleek profile. Also, it's a must have for any collector (as availability is VERY limited) and anyone who loves the Huarache or Nike Free line as it is an ingenious combination of both. It also incorporates the awesome Nike+ sensor slot (for activity tracking and analysis on Nikeplus.com).CONS:I am a regular size 14 so I purchased a 14. I attempted to try them on and was stopped by the sockliner. After forcing my way through the limited stretch opening, I found my foot literally constricted by the inner liner. I COULD NOT WALK IN THEM. It was as though it was a size 12 sockliner in a size 14 shoe. I have MANY Huarache and Free shoes and while some Huarache's were snug, NONE of them were this ill-fitting.RECOMMENDATION:If you have an abnormally thin foot, this shoe will fit well and look even better on you! If you're by any means \"normal\", order the next half size up. For those bigger than 14, know that THERE IS NO 14.5. You COULD order a 15, but beware of the extra space in the toe box if you plan to do any actual sporting in these.

To those who are looking to buy these shoes i wouldn't because you might not get the size that you want, the style looks great its just they might trick you with the size so i give all this 1 star until this could be resolved", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "shoes not actual size", "unixReviewTime": 1368403200, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2013"}

I was using Asics as a more running focused shoe, but eventually developed back pain and ITBS (PAINFUL!). On a recommendation from a friend, I switched to the original Nike Free Run+, which solved all of my pain issues - I felt like I could run forever in those and enthusiastically recommended them to anyone that would listen. Eventually, they wore out and I had to upgrade, so the Free Run+ 3 seemed the logical choice. However, they modified it to actually have a tongue again (instead of the original \"sleeve\" design) as well as a number of so-called improvements. Since getting these shoes and doing a number of 6 mile runs, I've redeveloped ITBS. I've had back and forth correspondence with Nike reps, and have tried all of their suggestions for adjusting the shoe, but I have had no luck and I am ready to toss these out of the window. Maybe it's just my feet and my running style, but I will not be coming back to the Nike Free's until they go back to the original design with fewer moving parts.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Please bring back the original Free's!", "unixReviewTime": 1353283200, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2012"}

Everyday it seems like it is slowly getting worse, and I fear this pair will not even get close to lasting a year.What is not as annoying as a loose thong sandal, though very disappointing, is something aesthetically wrong with a Nike product. The red that most likely attracted everyone here, is already wearing away in the spots I must rest my weight upon. I think this is unacceptable from authentic Nike merchandise, which is why I'm not very satisfied.I thought these Celso Motion sandals were going to be the ying to my yang (turqouise/orange Free 3's). We'll see how this story plays out; I'm just not very satisfied, nor &#34;feel good&#34; with this purchase.6.5/10 or 7/10", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nike only in appearance.", "unixReviewTime": 1372291200, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2013"}

I do have to say I am disappointed with the overall fit and quality of this product though. I order medium whenever I get compression shorts... I have 4 Under Armour ones and this Nike one. I have 0 complaints about the UA products however I received the Nike last so I had worn all my UA ones prior for  about 3 weeks of strenuous daily exercise prior to wearing the Nike's. The fit is definitely not a medium more like a smeedium and it hugs too tight IN like pushing in the crotch and just on the cuff near the knee's which completely sucks when your moving all around and sweating. Also the material while intended to be &#34;lightweight&#34; just seems cheap, they are basically see through even the black pair and the tightness coupled with the material popped a string from the seam with minimal stretching while removing them post workout.I am not an idiot I am not rough with my clothing especially not 40$ underwear and I am in pretty good shape too so its not like I ripped it on accident or purpose they just arent that great of quality.The product itself in the next size up would probably be pretty good, however due to the straight up cheap seeming material this product gets 3 stars, and is definitely not worth the extra 10$ over an Under Armour product. No I am not a marketer I have plenty more Nike apparel than UA anyways...I will be buying 1 or two more pairs of this in red/black and green/black in the larger size so if you have the money to spend and your an athlete I still recommend this product just be gentle and make sure to get a size up.

If you have the slightest worry about wearing socks that are too tight, then you'll want to stay far away from these and stick with Gold Toe, Adidas or some other good brand.  The sock openings are so small you can barely get them on, and after you do, they act as a compression sock around your foot and ankles (note that I don't simply mean that they're articulated, but that they actually tightly squeeze you.)The L/R foot designations seems neat, but I'm not sure that there's actually any difference, or that it would be worth it if there was.  It mostly serves to add another step in putting them on, if you actually put them on the right foot, which I doubt most people even bother doing.My only reason for giving these 2 stars is because Nike does seem to put forth some effort in designing them, but I find that Gold Toe makes far better socks.

Pain when accelerating is pretty sharp and distracting.  I would definitely recommend buying from a store when you can try on the pair you're going to buy.  I went to the store before buying these and tried a pair that seemed to fit fine, but these were much tighter.  I don't know if they shrunk or were mis-labelled.  The label inside says US 12.

They're a great combination of minimal design and enough cushion.Pain:It pains me to hear how here about how Nike treats sponsored athletes. The word on the street is that Nike provides no advance notice of contract termination and retroactively applies performance clauses. Essentially, Nike sometime as acts as a jerk when it transitions away from athletes.With $521 million net profit in Fiscal 2012 3rd Quarter alone, Nike has the room in their budget to afford to treat sponsored athletes fairly.Nike's CFO might say Nike has a business case can be made for their actions. He should keep in mind that I'm not made of money but I'd rather pay $125 instead of $100 for a pair of shoes if I knew this would ensure that sponsored athletes are being treated fairly.

I will say that these shoes run maybe a half inch smaller, which I've noticed on my size 13 feet, but after a few runs, they fit well. Another thing that kind of bothered me was the fact that the bottom of the shoe is red, the details are red...until you get to the inside of the shoe. Color me silly for not looking up the color scheme beforehand, but the &#34;neon orange&#34; inside of the shoe is a bit of an eyesore for me. Of course, it doesn't affect the performance of the shoe in the slightest, neither does it glow in the dark, but if you're one of those runners than prefer solid colors (like myself), this might take off a few points.I normally run with either thin socks or none when I wear these shoes. They feel great either way. For those of you that run cross country (XC) or anything that will put miles on your shoes faster, I'd lean toward wearing some inserts, unless you just enjoy the feel.

You can force its removal.The sole doesn't seem like it would be good, has a kind of gel appearance and feels like plastic; but it has traction like gum rubber;  it is stiff.  The shoe is quite comfortable.  How well it lasts, I don't know, but according to the label it was manufactured between March and May of 2007.  It was made in China.Hence if the shoe even now appears nearly new, it was rarely worn: the sole's tread seems new, but has dirt in it.  That may indicate problems with the shoe.

There's no longer any &#34;bounce&#34; or &#34;spring&#34; to my steps and started developing outside arch pain due to the lack of support in that spot.

I wouldn't even walk around for a day in these anymore - not enough support for my low arch.Size: I measure a size 6.5 but it's always recommend to buy a  size up, so I got a size 7 wide.

{"reviewerID": "A16UAJF8U804R3", "asin": "B00ANBSACG", "reviewerName": "Mathew Cohn \"Learny McLearner\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I've been playing soccer recreationally for 3 years and have gone through about 6 pairs of cleats in this time.  These cleats are by far the worst I've ever worn, and that includes the $20 pair Diadoras I bought from Big 5.Pros:- awesome neon colorsCons:- thick plastic synthetic uppers have absolutely no give, do not break in- hard, narrow soles have chewed up my feet like no other cleat has ever done.  I've built up 20 layers of callus on the ball of each foot, a portion of which rips off every week.  It's beginning to look like that pit from 300.  But instead of shouting WE ARE SPARTA!!! and kicking the Persian into the pit, it just hurts.- the toebox is freakishly narrow.  It squeezes the toes together such that they become numb within seconds of lacing them up. No feeling = no feel.  To compound the problem, the upper forms around the foot in a fashion that creates a round surface, which makes for an impossibly unpredictable touch.  I CANNOT accurately strike the ball in these cleats.  I'll take the same touch 10 times and it will go in 10 different places, often extremely widely separated in distance. That should never happen.- the lack of control is not limited to the toebox but extents to the whole shoe.  The heel is so stiff, thick and narrow that simple back-touches that are routine in my other cleats are unpredictable to the extent that they often clang off my plant foot. And passing touches off the inside of the foot often skip right off the cleat and curve wildly.I've bought Nike cleats before, and I've never been satisfied with their durability. I've never had a Nike cleat last longer than six months (usually closer to 2 or 3) without the soles tearing off the uppers in predictable and aggravating places.  These are slightly better in that regard, likely due to the fact that the uppers are made from 80 layers bulletproof vinyl.  They have only removed themselves a fraction of a bit from the soles just posterior to the ball of the foot, where all of my cleats have done.If you MUST own Nikes, I recommend the T90 line.  They have a much wider toebox that is not only more comfortable but results in a hell of a lot better control on strikes and passes.  The uppers are thinner, more forgiving and offer vastly improved feel in comparison to the Mercurial Victory IV, and the touch all around the cleat including the heel is infinitely better.  I rarely mistouch while wearing them and can place it accurately 9 times out of 10.  In addition to the wider toebox, the off-center laces provide greater surface area for striking. The uppers are also flatter on top, resulting in a much more powerful and accurate strike.  Of all the features of the shoes, my favorite is probably on the tongue.  It's wide, it sits flat, and it's extremely comfortable.  Unlike the thick, miserable tongue on the Victory IV's which chews into your foot as soon as you tighten the laces.I purchased the Mercurial Victory IV's after being disappointed with the pathetic durability of the T90 Shoot IV's.  They shredded themselves in several places where the upper meets the sole. They DO NOT handle wet conditions.  They also have this plastic textured material meant to help you curve the ball, which it definitely does, however if you're playing with any of the run-of-the-mill soccer balls sold in stores like the Nike Predator, they will catch on the ball covering and trip you occasionally as you are dribbling.  I swore I'd never wear Nike's again after the Victories, as they are across-the-board ridiculously overpriced fragile pieces of crap.  However, after wearing these cleats today for the first time in 6 months since I bought the Mercurial Victory IV's, they felt like angels kissing my feet.  Suddenly all of the touches that I routinely botched with the Victories were perfectly on point again.  When I got home from the game I immediately purchased a pair of the T90 Strikes, which are supposedly the slightly higher quality version of the T90 Shoots - because I was actually able to get them for a lower price than the T90 Shoots.  I hope the sizing and fit is the same.  Being Nike's, I'm sure they'll shred themselves just as quickly, but California's drought will preserve them for longer.  Either way, they will be well worth the $55 dollars I spent on them if they preserve my feet for the next few months of 4 days of soccer a week.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Absolutely the worst cleat I've ever used", "unixReviewTime": 1405036800, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2014"}

I bought a pair of these at a local nike outlet and initially loved them so much I bought another pair through amazon. I like to run 1/2 marathons and while the shoe felt great at first I started having problems once I started doing longer runs (4 or more miles) or using the treadmill. I have flat feet, or more accurately, flat foot as my right foot is flat but not my left. I began feeling pain in my lateral ankle that only seemed to appear and worsen when I ran. At first I thought I was increasing my mileage or speed too fast and got an overuse injury, but it turns out it was the shoes. Halfway through a particularly painful run I switched my shoes back to my old partially worn out Nike Vomero's and the pain went away instantly and I was able to finish my run. I am hoping to return these as I've only worn this pair for a few miles on the treadmill my other pair got the brunt of the mileage. I have ordered a pair of Nike Pegasus 30's which are like the Vomero's but cheaper- a solid shoe with excellent cushioning which will be better for my type of feet.

Not fakes by any means I studied them upon receiving them greatly and they seemed somewhat on point but there were a few things about it that made me think they are b-grades. 1. Box was in terrible shape, not only that but the seller did not double box it for shipping. A bag around a box of shoes loosely tossed and turned in the UPS truck perhaps made it more beat up than it should have been. On top of that when I opened it the shoes looked to have some immediate flaws as Nike usually does on any of their outlet items. One the area above the toe box where the lacing begins was raised up like it had been warped by heat damage. It is something that may go away with wear though as the material learns to grasp on to the shape of the foot. Another issue was the holes created for the fly wire to come through look very ugly. It may not be noticeable from a distance, but damn up close it looks pretty hideous especially on this white mesh and fuse material used on that part of the upper. The flywire was very loose and makes re-lacing the Lebron X a pain. That icy blue bottom is pretty yellow, and not blue at all. Positives are the fit and feel when the shoe is on foot. Heel Cup is extremely supportive though when I tried it on, and the shoe fit my slightly wide foot very well. I go half a size up in running shoes, but for some basketball shoes like the Kobe 8 which is very tight I have to re-do the laces a particular way to have them comfortably fit on my feet to use size ten. In these there was no such issue and there is much more space toward the front of my ankle. I have pretty deep arches and I felt that this shoe supported that well. Lastly the design and colors really look nice although have some obvious flaws like the icy translucent blue being very clear and yellow although those gold flakes are a nice touch. I like the shoe but in hindsight I would not pay more than 150$ for this, the price is ridiculous and Nike is making a killing off Lebron's name and hype. Do yourself a favor and save the money, unless you NEED this shoe specifically for the way it fits and plays, there are plenty of other, cheaper options to explore.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "B-Grade?", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2014"}

It's not like I'm new to Nike's...If you want my perspective on it, I'd describe the shoelace length like buying a belt in your waist size only to find out the belt only holds up one side of your pants. It's ridiculous and Nike ought to know better but Amazon buying these shoes and re-selling them to customers ought to really know better through showing some initiative on quality assurance.I was planning on buying 3 more pair from Amazon but instead went to a retail store and received a price match and got the correct length shoelace. As for me, this is the first and last time I buy shoes online.As a matter of fact, I haven't purchased anything else from Amazon since the last 2 products I purchased were less than satisfactory and it just may be my last..

Pierce \"rock and/or roller\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "These shoes are perfect for the casual runner, that is, one who averages 3 or so miles at a nice jog and isn't overly concerned with pacing and distance.  The gym is a good place, as is cross fit.After my brief love affair with the original Free Flyknit in Rainbow Vomit color scheme, I decided to give the newer, lighter iteration a go.  I used the Free Flyknit 5.0 for a good 6 months, averaging about 4 miles with maximums of 6, at a good pace too (~ 6:45/mile); then I realized that anything further and the shoes began to hold me back, like I was running through mud.I gave these a shot, though, as I wanted a new distance shoe and figured maybe it was just the weirdness of the inaugural shoe.  It wasn't, for me at least.  The same issue persists, even with a revamped sole and upper.  And I think the former is the problem.  i've never felt truly &#34;fast&#34; in any of the frees; maybe the very first ones back in 2003, but I was in the Army then and running a lot against my will.The sole is not a single mass; it's several pods or hexagons that are fused to the insole and allow the shoe to flex with nearly every subtle movement of the foot.  Nike WANTS this to translate to a more natural feel, and yet I think it over exaggerates it.  Whereas some shoes of the same minimalist vain succeed in this area by keeping the sole one whole piece, Nike went a bit too far.  II think what's happening is the sole is allowing impact energy to spread across each individual pod, and when there's more surface area I feel like the shoe begins to work against the runner.  Basically, the pods are too independent and cushy to allow for an optimal strike and return - anything more than 3 miles and I start to feel like I'm running through mud.  This could be such a good shoe if the sole were more, substantial: maybe a bit thinner but stiffer.  The upper is fantastic though.  So, I don't recommend this shoe for anyone who wants to work on speed or distance.

I never buy low top basketball shoes, but I liked the way they looked.  Totally my fault.  They fit ok, but the support around the heel really digs into the outside of my foot and causes pain to shoot up my entire calf.  Plus, since they are low top you have zero ankle support....which is extremely important in basketball.  The bottom of the shoe offers little traction on indoor basketball courts and the material the shoe is made out of really prohibits you from breaking them in properly.  It's almost as if they are like brand new shoes every time you wear them.  Bottom line...they are visually appealing but that's about it.
